```javascript
const apiUrl = 'https://api.jsonbin.io/v3/b/670101afacd3cb34a8919055';
```

If you want to use your own data, follow these steps:

##### Steps:

2. Create a new bin with your JSON data.
3. JSONBin will give you an API endpoint to access this data.
4. Replace the `apiUrl` with your new API link.
